            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9 inch square pan. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg. Set aside.In a large bowl, cream together the shortening, brown sugar and white sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the milk, mixing just until incorporated. Stir in the chopped apples.Spread batter evenly in prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool.To make the frosting: In a medium bowl, combine 1/4 cup shortening, confectioners' sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg. Beat until light and creamy. Beat in the milk, one tablespoon at a time, until desired spreading consistency is achieved. Spread over top of cooled cake.Really nice recipe! I added extra apples like some reviewers before me. I also added chopped almonds and almond extract which I HIGHLY reccomend! Very tasty! My only complaint was that once I got the icing on there, the combination was a little too sweet for me. I think I would cut back on the sugar in the cake it's self, as the icing was really yummy. I will deffinetly make this again. Thanks for sharing this recipe!.Well....I don't see what the big "tado" is about this cake! I've had numerous apple cakes that would put this one to shame. The nutmeg was way TOO much...and honestly I thought the cake was quite bland. I tasted it before I made the frosting, and decided not to waste the ingredients. Sorry!Really nice recipe!
